Pipeline
======

Simple Rails app for internal financial tracking

About
----
Pipeline was created to replace an Excel spreadsheet that was used internally at my last internship. It contained 
too much data to be efficiently viewed and careless keystrokes causes regular problems. The idea of 
this app was to recreate the user experience of the spreadsheet (to mitigate transition problems) while benefiting from the enhanced
functionality of a Rails app.

Why I'm proud of this
----
Prior to Ruby training at Jumpstart Lab, my programming experience only involved Linux shell scripts.
This was my first attempt at a Rails app so I had to learn a few associated applications first. I started learning:

Bundler

rvmrc

Git

GitHub

Heroku

jQuery/AJAX

CSS/CoffeeScript

HTML

MySQL

FactoryGirl/Cucumber

Scrum


Added to this was the upgrade to Rails 3, a ThoughtBot TDD class and my senior year at UNC-Charlotte. I'm proud of the hard work I put into this app and all the things I learned in a relatively short period of time. I also gained an appreciation for the RoR community and their helpful demeanor. It was a tough time but I made serious progress.
